            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Building my first computer at 13 years old was the spark that ignited my life-long passion for technology and science. My tenure at my current job has pushed me to be a hard-working, dedicated individual with a wide array of knowledge of both hardware and software. It has allowed me to learn the practicality, patience, and detail that is involved when working with technology in complex business environments.</p>
