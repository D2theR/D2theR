Hello, please check out my stuff!

[About Me](https://danrerko.com)

## Current Project Ideas/Goals:

### FELV Cat Website:
- Documents the various cats my wife and I have adopted with FeLV or Feline Luekemia virus, their personalities and lives.
- Information and resources on how to care for a positive cat.
- Mach adoption pages with names, breads, and descriptions (via API calls to FastAPI).

### [Street Cat Tracker](https://github.com/D2theR/street_cat_tracker):
- Uses OpenCV, and a Google Coral TPU to log animal events (mostly cats) in my yard and report back to an MQTT Broker/Home Assistant.

### Open MES:
- An open source Manufacturing Execution System (MES) platform for guiding small/medium size manufacturers in building, following, and migrating to an IIoT 4.0 business model.
- Could potential runs on baremetal or simple hardware like Raspberry Pi's or small form factor PC's.
- Uses Docker Compose, EMQX, InfluxDB, & Node-RED.
- Hardware/Software recommendations sections for data acquisition:
    - Raspberry Pi's
    - ESP Modules
    - Arduino

### Nuxt Storj Bucket
- Template for building and deploying a Nuxt project that uses a Storj bucket as a CDN or CMS.
